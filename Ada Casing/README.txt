IMPORTANT NOTE

To facilitate expediency in releasing these files, these are the actual production files that were to be use for Ada's production run. 

As such, they may include 'Triggertrap', 'Ada' and 'Tt' logos, and references to 'TimeWarp', all of which are trademarked. If you intend to use these files, ensure that the logos are removed from the models, PCB, and source code etc before they are used. 

The files may also include references to FCC and CE marking and certification. These tests were completed with prototypes, but the certifications may not apply to you. As such, please ensure that the FCC and CE markings are removed, or that your device is re-certified, before you use these files.
